			<h1>Analysing Yelp Restaurant Dataset</h1>
			<h3>Narrative Visualization d3.js using the Yelp dataset<br />Yeow Long, Chua - CS416 Narrative Visualization</h3>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>This narrative visualization is an interactive slideshow which takes the user through the Yelp restaurant dataset. The dataset consists of the reviews and aggregated check-ins over time of numerous businesses located throughout various metropolitans across the globe but we'll only focus on a couple of states in the United States to reduce the computational complexity of the preprocessing of the dataset. This visualization focuses on the data from the United States which includes the following states: British Columbia, Colarado, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas and Washington.</p>
			<h2>Visual Structure</h2>
			<p>This visualizations utilizes a static canvas of 1024x768 pixels, users should view the interactive visualization with a resolution of at least 1280x800 pixels to ensure optimal compatibility and ensure that the text and elements are at the right positions.</p>
			<h2>Analysing the Dataset</h2>
			<p>This dataset is a huge dataset with a size of 10GB and to streamline preprocessing, we have only extracted restaurant checkins to between 100 to 500 and reduced the states to just 8 states. This is to ensure that the restaurants have a minimum amount of checkins as well as ensuring that the checkins are not too excessive and also to reduce the computational complexity.</p>
			<h2>Visual Scenes</h2>
			<p>We provided a coherent look for the interactive visualization using CSS and FullPage.js. Each page is transitioned similar to a slideshow and text elements are consistent across the slides. We also provided a navigation bar for users to skip between various slides and simple tooltips are triggered when the user mouse overs the navigation bar area.</p>
			<h2>Annotations</h2>
			<p>We have utilized annotations and triggers are used to change the hidden parameter of the annotation. The Line Chart Visualization has an initial state of the hidden parameter which controls the display of the annotations set to false. As a user uses the brush bar to zoom on specific timelines, this will trigger changes to the line chart's horizontal axis, it will activate this hidden parameter. Also, the annotation will revert back to the default state when the user resets the brush bars.</p>
			<h2>Parameters and Triggers</h2>
			<p>Both parameters and triggers are used in the line chart. We have parameters set for each state. These parameters are updated as we mouse over the line chart, providing the user with a real-time udpate of the amount of check-ins in a specified time. Another parameter is the brush bar below the line chart, This bar allows the user to zoom into the data to show a closer look of the data. As a user uses the brush bar to zoom on specific timelines, this will trigger changes to the line chart's horizontal axis to be updated to the selected section of the brush bar and this is proportional to the horizontal axis of the line chart.</p>

			<h1>The Yelp Dataset</h1>
			<p>The restaurant business is a very competitive industry where analyzing customer behaviour and preferences will give restaurant owners the much needed edge over the competition. This interactive slideshow brings us through the Yelp Academic Dataset which includes a large set of reviews and interactions across multiple countries. In this analysis, we will focus on restaurants within the United States and the outcome is to better understand client behavior and trend.</p><br />
			<p>We have assumed that there is a positive correlation between the number of checkins of a particular restaurant as well as the popularity or customer flow of the restaurant. By focusing just on number of checkins of between 100 to 500, we hope to obtain an effective representation of the general population in the state.</p>

		<div id="linechart_content">
			<div id="linechart_text">
				<p>Aggregating the hourly check-ins per restaurant location/state reveals that Texas/TX has the most customer checkins. The chart illustrates shows the checkins across the different days of the week and we see that there is a cyclic relationship between the number of check-ins and the time of the day. The amount of check-ins peaks out near the end of the day but note that this peak hour might differ slightly from state to state. There is also a general increase in the amount of checkins over the weekend.</p>

			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>​The analysis based on the Yelp Dataset shows that if we open a restaurant at Texas/TX, we should target this customer segment which are more tech-savy and run marketing campaign specifically for them. Also from the data, we see that there are much more customer checkins during the evenings and nights rather than the afternoon, perhaps we could run promotions during day-time, to encourage more patrons to the restaurant.</p>
